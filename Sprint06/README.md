# 📊 Sprint 6 Project – SQL Fundamentals

## 📌 Project Overview
This project was completed as part of **Sprint 6** in the TripleTen Data Science Bootcamp.  
The focus of this sprint was to build foundational skills in **SQL** for working with relational databases.  
Through a series of exercises and queries, the project demonstrates how to extract, filter, aggregate, and join data effectively.

The primary goals of this project were:
- ✅ Connect to and query a relational database.
- ✅ Practice GROUP BY clauses.
- ✅ Perform joins and aggregations to answer business questions.
- ✅ Gain confidence using SQL for data analysis.
