# 📊 Sprint 5 Project – Integrated Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project was completed as part of **Sprint 5** in the TripleTen Data Science Bootcamp.  
The focus of this sprint was to bring together skills from the previous sprints into a **cumulative analysis project**.  
This included data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and applying statistical reasoning to extract insights.

The primary goals of this project were:
- ✅ Combine knowledge from earlier sprints into a single workflow.
- ✅ Clean and prepare data for analysis.
- ✅ Explore data visually and statistically.
- ✅ Summarize findings and communicate results effectively.
