# 🤖 Sprint 7 Project – Introduction to Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project was completed as part of **Sprint 7** in the TripleTen Data Science Bootcamp.  
The focus of this sprint was to build and evaluate **basic machine learning models** to solve a real problem, using Python libraries and foundational ML concepts.

The primary goals of this project were:
- ✅ Prepare data for machine learning.
- ✅ Train, test, and evaluate a simple model.
- ✅ Compare performance metrics and interpret results.
- ✅ Build a foundation for more advanced ML workflows.

## 🚀 Key Sections of the Notebook

- [📦 **Data Preparation**]  
  Loading the dataset, handling missing values, and splitting data into features and target.

- [⚙️ **Model Training**]
  Building a baseline model (e.g., linear regression, decision tree) and fitting it to the data.

- [📈 **Model Evaluation**]
  Measuring performance with metrics such as accuracy, RMSE, or R² and interpreting results.

- [🔧 **Model Tuning & Insights**]
  Adjusting parameters, comparing models, and summarizing findings.
