# 💼 Sprint 9 Project – Machine Learning for Business

## 📌 Project Overview
This project was completed as part of **Sprint 9** in the TripleTen Data Science Bootcamp.  
The focus of this sprint was to apply **machine learning techniques in a business context** to solve real-world problems and deliver actionable insights.

The primary goals of this project were:
- ✅ Frame a business question that can be addressed with ML.
- ✅ Prepare and preprocess the dataset for modeling.
- ✅ Train and evaluate multiple models to select the best performer.
- ✅ Interpret results and outline recommendations for business decisions.
