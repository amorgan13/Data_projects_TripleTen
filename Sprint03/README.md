# 📊 Sprint 3 Project – Statistical Data Analysis (SDA)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project was completed as part of **Sprint 3** in the TripleTen Data Science Bootcamp.  
The focus of this sprint was to apply **Statistical Data Analysis (SDA)** methods to explore hypotheses and better understand relationships in data.

The primary goals of this project were:
- ✅ Perform descriptive statistics on key variables.
- ✅ Test hypotheses using statistical methods.
- ✅ Interpret results to draw meaningful conclusions.
- ✅ Continue building on Python and data analysis workflows.
