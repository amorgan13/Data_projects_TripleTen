# 📝 Sprint 14 Project – Machine Learning with Text Data

## 📌 Project Overview
This project was completed as part of **Sprint 14** in the TripleTen Data Science Bootcamp.  
The focus of this sprint was to work with **text data** and apply natural language processing (NLP) techniques alongside machine learning models.

The primary goals of this project were:
- ✅ Preprocess and clean text data.
- ✅ Perform feature extraction using methods like TF-IDF or Count Vectorizer.
- ✅ Train and evaluate ML models on text-based features.
- ✅ Interpret model results and understand challenges specific to text data.
